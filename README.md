## Brief Introduction to League of Legends and this Project

League of Legends, often abbreviated as "LoL" is an online multiplayer video game designed by Riot Games. Part of the Mulitplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) genre, League of Legends consists of 10 total players: 5 on each team for a total of 2 teams. Both teams pilot video game characters known as "champions" and play in an arena called "Summoner's Rift." Summoner's Rift consists of 2 bases (one for each team) located on opposite sides of the map. The objective of each team is to destroy the enemy base by piloting these different champions. In order to destroy the enemy base, players destroy towers in order to get closer to the enemy base, kill minions to buy items and get experience so they can become stronger, and, most importantly, kill each other so that the enemy cannot defend their own base.

League of Legends is a massively popular video game and has been for over 10 years. Due to its popularity, the video game has developed a large following, eventually forming what we now know as League of Legends eSports. Each year across the globe, players across the globe form teams and play in regional leagues such as the LPL, LCK, LEC, and LCS. At the end of the year each year (around October), the best teams from each region gather every year to play in the biggest League of Legends tournament hosted by Riot Games in order to determine the best team of that year. This tournament is known as Worlds.

In this project, I will be exploring the champions played during Worlds. This project includes cleaning up data as well as answering questions that I have been personally interested in, such as

What champion is the most overpowered?

What champion historically has the highest kills?

What about the highest deaths?
